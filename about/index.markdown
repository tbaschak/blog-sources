<p>Theo is an experienced network and system operator, and definitely a BOFH. He has 16 years experience administering core internet technologies like HTTP, HTTPS and DNS on Linux, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD platforms, and 10 years experience operating routed ISP networks from small thru province-wide including operating a satellite network. He has extensive experience running large IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack networks with static routes, RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, and BGP.</p>

<p>After experiences all over the scale, he prefers running BGP, on well planned, well documented, fully redundant networks. He currently operates <a href="http://as14866.net/" target="_blank">AS14866</a> (<a href="http://voinetworksolutions.com/" target="_blank">Voi Network Solutions</a>) as well as <a href="http://bgp.he.net/AS62758" target="_blank">AS62758</a> (<a href="http://www.mfnerc.com/" target="_blank">MFNERC</a>). He also assists with the operations and administration of AS62962 and AS62589, as well as other fellow Internet Exchange members where needed.</p>

Being a strong advocate for BGP, and what it can do, Theo is involved with both Internet Exchanges in Winnipeg. He helped create the <a href="http://wpgix.net/" target="_blank">Winnipeg Internet Exchange</a>, and he also sits on the board of the <a href="http://www.mbix.ca/" target="_blank">Manitoba Internet Exchange</a>. He was also instrumental in bringing MFNERC to BGP readiness, as well as operational readiness -- expediting the process with Shaw during a normal network brown period.

Theo likes simplicity. Nice, simple things like Markdown. That is why this blog/website uses <a href="http://octopress.org/" target="_blank">Octopress</a>. Every part of this website (blog posts, pages, etc) are all generated from Markdown source pages and then baked to static HTML files and shipped over to the webserver. He also writes all his documentation in Markdown, and uses <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/" target="_blank">pandoc</a> to generate other (HTML, PDF, Word, etc) formats as necessary using Makefiles.
