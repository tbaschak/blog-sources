I've long been a fan of [IP Chicken](http://www.ipchicken.com/), however it isn't anycasted, and it doesn't support IPv6. I've had a non-anycasted IPv4/IPv6 capable version called [ipfowl](https://github.com/tbaschak/ipfowl) which I run at http://ip.henchman21.net/

Enter my new creation: [IP Quail](http://ipquail.com)

I set out to create my own service which I could host at [HenchCDN](http://henchcdn.com), a local CDN which aims to anycast content via several internet exchanges to be nearer to end users. I purchased [ipquail.com](http://ipquail.com/) and set it up on my two HenchCDN nodes, and after several revisions, I had a web service up and running.

Instead of using PHP, since it only needs to display the REMOTE_ADDR, I changed to using simple SSI. This ensures much higher performance. I'm using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) for simplicity, cross platform responsiveness, and to grid and style the page elements.
