<a href="http://xkcd.com/" target="_blank">XKCD</a> is an awesome webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language. It often has UNIX shell jokes, and other sysadmin humor as well. One <a href="http://xkcd.com/936/" target="_blank">particularly funny comic strip</a> focuses on how terrible passwords are for people to remember, but easy for computers to guess.

I'm glad to see various implementations on <a href="https://github.com/search?q=xkcd+password&ref=opensearch" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. The project named <a href="https://github.com/beala/xkcd-password" target="_blank">xkpa</a> is my favorite. Easy to pass on to users (prevents additional back and forth due to insanely complex generated passwords), as well as indicating passwords entropy and average time to crack.
