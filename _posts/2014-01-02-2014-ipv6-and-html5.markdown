I've switched to using a new site/blog engine, <a href="http://octopress.org/" target="_blank">Octopress</a>. It uses markdown, which is my new favorite way of writing things. It lets you focus on writing text, and uses simple wiki-like formatting. It also allows you to intersperse HTML where needed.

Coming soon, a more in depth article about how to setup a VM for OpenBSD running OpenBGPD as a BGP looking glass, then after that, the same thing with Bird running on FreeBSD or Linux. After that, more IPv6! I think 2014 will turn out to be rather important for IPv6.

I have been very busy this winter on infrastructure related projects. I've <a href="https://github.com/tbaschak/bsideswpg2013-ISPInfoSec" target="_blank">presented</a> at <a href="http://bsideswpg.ca" target="_blank">BSidesWpg</a> (a local security conference), turned up several new AS numbers on the internet, moved a giant learning management system from Saskatchewan to Manitoba, and been busy designing big network things. I have also been looking at <a href="https://github.com/ahebert/BigPlg" target="_blank">BigPlg</a>, which looks very interesting indeed.

This new blogging engine makes it super easy to embed a GitHub Gist too!
