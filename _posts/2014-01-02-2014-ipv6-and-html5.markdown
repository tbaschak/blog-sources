I've switched to using a new site/blog engine, [Octopress](http://octopress.org/). It uses markdown, which is my new favorite way of writing things. It lets you focus on writing text, and uses simple wiki-like formatting. It also allows you to intersperse HTML where needed.

Coming soon, a more in depth article about how to setup a VM for OpenBSD running OpenBGPD as a BGP looking glass, then after that, the same thing with Bird running on FreeBSD or Linux. After that, more IPv6! I think 2014 will turn out to be rather important for IPv6.

I have been very busy this winter on infrastructure related projects. I've [presented](https://github.com/tbaschak/bsideswpg2013-ISPInfoSec) at [BSidesWpg](http://bsideswpg.ca) (a local security conference), turned up several new AS numbers on the internet, moved a giant learning management system from Saskatchewan to Manitoba, and been busy designing big network things. I have also been looking at [BigPlg](https://github.com/ahebert/BigPlg), which looks very interesting indeed.

This new blogging engine makes it super easy to embed a GitHub Gist too!
