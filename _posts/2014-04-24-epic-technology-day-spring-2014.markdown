I attended [Epic Technology Day](http://techday.ca/) (Wednesday, April 23, 2014) for the first time this year. I've often wanted to go, but not been sure of my schedule. This year I opted to register and see what came along. I was able to attend the full day in the end, and I had a great time and learned a lot as well. I was hoping that Brocade would be giving away one of their VDX switches as a door prize, but that wasn't the case. :-) The door prizes given away were pretty decent though, including several vendor's AP products.

The sessions which I took in were (in order):

*	Manitoba Data Centre Overview (Epic &amp; Ehvert Mission Critical)
*	Data Center Evolution - Goodbye Complicated and Hello Automated (Brocade)
*	Introduction to Software-Defined Networking (SDN) (Brocade)
*	Manitoba Data Centre Overview (Epic &amp; Ehvert Mission Critical)
*	MTS Wavelength Overview (MTS)

Yes, I took in the data centre overview twice, the first time (9:00AM) was so packed, I had to stand in the back and didn't catch everything. The second time around I had a seat near the front at a table even. I enjoyed all the sessions I took in, they were both entertaining and informative as well.

I was a little surprised and somewhat saddened to not see IPv6 mentioned on the program or hear it mentioned in a session. Generally, I find the lack of drive towards end user IPv6 deployment in Manitoba absolutely astonishing, and very ["head in the sand"](http://www.howfunky.com/2010/10/ipv6-ostrich-effect.html).
