I've been a big fan of [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) for quite some time now, to the point where I've almost considered purchasing a license for it. Today I discovered [Atom](https://atom.io/), an open sourced editor by Github. Atom is visually quite similar to Sublime Text, from its file layout on the left, its command pallet, and its tabbed interface. I think Atom will replace Sublime Text as my regular text editor.

<!--more-->

The color scheme is nice out of the box, a list of files on the left hand side, a dark grey window on the right. The editor itself is Markdown aware, showing small syntax highlights for various Markdown elements. It is also aware of git repos, showing the current branch, and number of changed lines in the bottom right, and the status of each file on the left based on color (grey, green, orange).

It also includes a binary optionally installed in ```/usr/local/bin/atom``` (on Mac anyways)

```
