This week I noticed my traceroute from one AS I run to another had changed, it appeared that TeraGo was leaking one or more routes.

<!--more-->

The traceroute:

```
$ tcptraceroute -q1 secure.ciscodude.net

The hop in question is hop 8. TeraGo? Thats strange, they used to be an AS14866 transit provider, I wonder if this is related. I confirmed that my route received at AS62758 had TeraGo in the AS-PATH (6327 20161 22652 14866), and contacted Fibrenoire. Since traceroutes to other IP ranges advertised by AS14866 did not go through TeraGo, I immediately suspected an old prefix-list had been merged into TeraGo's configuration.

A traceroute to another subnet:

```
$ tcptraceroute -q1 192.69.40.1

```

Completely different path (6327 6939 14866). Shaw's nearest peering point with Hurricane is in Chicago. TeraGo is a Shaw transit customer. Hence, Shaw would localpref routes received via their customer, TeraGo, higher, and prefer the longer path.

The reverse path (from AS14866 to AS62758):

```
$ traceroute -q1 198.62.164.30

This issue has not yet been resolved by TeraGO NOC yet, this post will be updated as the situation unfolds.

*** Update: ***
Issue was not resolved by TeraGO, and instead TeraGO was depeered by FibreNoire.
