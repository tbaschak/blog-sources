I've been playing with SaltStack for a week or so now, and while I still haven't even scratched the surface of what it is capable of yet, I am certainly saving a pile of time using it already. I am now using it to maintain web directories on my anycast nodes (which I was already doing through git, this is just further automated now).

<!--more-->

My process was originally log into each system over ssh, then git pull each web directory. My process is now to run the following command on my salt master:

```
root@dev:~# salt -G roles:anycast cmd.run 'sh -c /home/theodore/gitupdate.sh'
h-186.wpg167lom.henchman21.net:
    Already up-to-date.
    From https://github.com/henchman21/ipquail
       6f97b23..9a6d878  master     -> origin/master
    Updating 6f97b23..9a6d878
    Fast-forward

```

The script /home/theodore/gitupdate.sh exists on each anycast node. It goes into each directory and does a git update as the appropriate user (sudo -u user -H cmd).
