With the deployment of a new nameserver at [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=f6432a6e1354) NYC3 yesterday (to replace one at NYC2, which doesn't have IPv6), I have hit a fairly significant personal milestone -- All of my public facing services are now fully IPv6 enabled. 

<!--more-->

This includes:

*	Various http/https websites running nginx and Apache
	*	Some of which are anycasted
*	Mail services
	*	SMTP (postfix)
	*	IMAPS (dovecot)
	*	POP3S (dovecot)
*	DNS
	*	Nameservers
	*	Recursive DNS
*	System services like SSH, FTP
*	SSL VPN which gives out IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
	*	Cisco ASA running Cisco ASA 9.1(3)
*	SaltStack
*	Nagios monitoring
	*	2 dual-stack instances

I enjoy the output from check-soa now for my zones:

In addition, I have native IPv6 access at home. There is also a local Hurricane Electric tunnel server in Winnipeg now, and also a local Hurricane anycast DNS resolver.
