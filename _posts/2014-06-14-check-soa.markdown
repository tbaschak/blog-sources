check-soa is a CLI tool written in go which lets a DNS name server administrator easily verify that all servers listed as authoritative are in sync and serving the same zone by verifying the SOA record. I use this tool nearly every day at work to verify that changes have propagated to all slave nameservers.

As you can see, it supports ipv4/ipv6:

```bash check-soa-sample-output.txt
$ check-soa -i ciscodude.net
ns0.ciscodude.net.
	2604:4280:d000:11::6: OK: 2014061301 (0 ms)
	199.202.21.6: OK: 2014061301 (0 ms)
ns2.henchman21.net.
	107.170.63.61: OK: 2014061301 (44 ms)
ns3.hcdn.pw.
	206.220.199.250: OK: 2014061301 (1 ms)
$ check-soa -i 21.202.199.in-addr.arpa
ns0.ciscodude.net.

```

The project is [hosted at github.com/bortzmeyer/check-soa](https://github.com/bortzmeyer/check-soa).

I've found that it doesn't build with the bundled version of golang in Debian wheezy, I had to install the latest stable binary package to resolve hash/tsig related errors.
