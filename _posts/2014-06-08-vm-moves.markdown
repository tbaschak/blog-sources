I've been planning to move my website out of my basement for quite a while, and over the last week I've finally executed on the plan. My plan was to setup an edge router running OpenBSD, route 199.202.21.0/24 and 2604:4280:d000::/44 to it, then run VMware ESXi free to run all the various services I want to.

I've setup the following in a half cabinet downtown:

*  1U Dell PE860, running OpenBSD 5.5
*  2U Dell R510, running VMware ESXi free 5.5u1
*  1U Cisco 3550-24 (layer2 only)
*  2U APC SmartUPS 750 w/ network management

This is a proof of concept, but even at this stage it allows me to move some services out of my basement. So far I've migrated secure.ciscodude.net (by creating a new VM), gitlab.henchman21.net  and nagios.henchman21.net (by moving the VM files). I've also setup a new dev.henchman21.net VM to replace dev.ciscodude.net, and ns0.ciscodude.net to be my primary nameserver.
