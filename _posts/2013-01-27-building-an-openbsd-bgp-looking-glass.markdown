One of the really handy things that has been included in OpenBSD for quite some while, is a handy shell, and CGI BGP looking glass. Rather than copy and paste someone elses blog, I'll just <a href="http://www.knowledgebombs.net/blog/2012/12/13/bgplg-from-scratch.html" target="_blank">link the handy guide I followed</a>. This guide is complete, including explaining why ping/ping6/traceroute/traceroute6 don't work under /var in the chrooted environment.

Since apache is being phased out in OpenBSD, I wonder what the solution will be for nginx? Someone will probably rewrite it in a fancy way.

***Update:*** I have since [written a blog](/blog/2014/05/14/openbsd-5-dot-5-bgplg/) about building an OpenBSD BGPLG with nginx.
