On a non-networking related note. I have been doing a little bit of web design, dabbling in HTML5. It has been quite enjoyable.

I have launched a new website for my wife's photography business, <a href="http://meaganlee.com" target="_blank">meaganlee.com</a>, and have also redesigned <a href="http://as14866.net" target="_blank">as14866.net</a> with HTML5 as well. In the process I noticed an AUP was missing, so I created one.

This blog (now running Octopress) is also baking HTML5 pages, with bootstrap! I <3 Bootstrap. Why generate essentially static content with a giant PHP engine, thats always being exploited and having login attepts made on. Static Content!!!!
