Now that I've got native IPv6 connectivity, I am even more excited about the next generation of the internet. I have been playing with tunneled IPv6 from he.net for roughly the past 8-10 years.

What to do with this new connectivity now though? How do you even know if Google or Facebook is loading over v4 or v6? <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ipvfox/" target="_blank">IPvFox</a> (for Firefox) or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipvfoo/ecanpcehffngcegjmadlcijfolapggal" target="_blank">ipvfoo</a> (for Chrome) can tell you with a small indicator by the URL bar. Perhaps you'd like to see the dancing <a href="http://www.kame.net/" target="_blank">Kame</a>?

If you want to know your IP address a-la <a href="http://www.ipchicken.com/" target="_blank">ipchicken.com</a> there is a v6 specific one at <a href="http://www.ipv6chicken.com/" target="_blank">ipv6chicken.com</a>. There is even a <a href="https://p.6core.net/" target="_blank">pastebin clone</a> with improved security-related/privacy functionality!

<a href="http://www.mirc.com/" target="_blank">mIRC</a> even supports IPv6 as of version 7.1 now!
