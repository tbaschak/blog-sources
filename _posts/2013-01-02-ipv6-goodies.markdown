Now that I've got native IPv6 connectivity, I am even more excited about the next generation of the internet. I have been playing with tunneled IPv6 from he.net for roughly the past 8-10 years.

<!--more-->

What to do with this new connectivity now though? How do you even know if Google or Facebook is loading over v4 or v6? [IPvFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ipvfox/) (for Firefox) or [ipvfoo](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipvfoo/ecanpcehffngcegjmadlcijfolapggal) (for Chrome) can tell you with a small indicator by the URL bar. Perhaps you'd like to see the dancing [kame](http://www.kame.net/)?

If you want to know your IP address a-la [ipchicken](http://www.ipchicken.com/) there is a v6 specific one at [ipv6chicken.com](http://www.ipv6chicken.com/). There is even a [pastebin clone](https://p.6core.net/) with improved security-related/privacy functionality!

[mIRC](http://www.mirc.com/) even supports IPv6 as of version 7.1 now!
