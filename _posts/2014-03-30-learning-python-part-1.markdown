I've heard a lot about python, its certainly a very popular language on [Github](http://github.com/), and I've been wanting to learn it for quite a while. This week ran though a quick 2-hour ["Up and Running with Python"](http://www.lynda.com/Python-tutorials/Up-Running-Python/122467-2.html) on Lynda.com. I've got some code experience, mostly from PHP and Perl scripts I've hacked to make sysadmin tasks easier, simple interfaces to databases, etc, but I'm certainly not a professional programmer.

I spent a little time today using [unifi-hackers/unifi-api](https://github.com/unifi-hackers/unifi-api) to interface with several UBNT Unifi controllers. In less than 30 minutes I had some pretty nice information coming out of I've also been hacking at [tbaschak/reflections](https://github.com/tbaschak/reflections) for the last few weeks, which is a Python/scapy project to explore several extremely common DOS vectors.
