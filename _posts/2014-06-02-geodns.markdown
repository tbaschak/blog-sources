I've been wanting to play with GeoDNS to direct clients to servers with content nearer to them for a long time. It seems that I've got two different options to explore, [Bind GeoIP patches](https://code.google.com/p/bind-geoip/) and [abh/geodns](https://github.com/abh/geodns) a GeoDNS server written in Go.

<!--more-->

One of the things which I noticed while patching for Heartbleed, was that my FreeBSD systems with ports took much longer to patch than my Debian systems. The Debian systems were simply ```apt-get update; apt-get upgrade``` with a reboot after. The Bind GeoIP patches aren't available as an a build option in FreeBSD. This means that I will need to maintain a custom build environment for this, and lose the ability to use the built in packaging benefits/speed.

I think in the long term, if abh/geodns does what I want it to, I will likely end up using it specifically for GeoDNS. I will probably keep using Bind for general DNS though, and perhaps fire up a MyDNS-ng server and start writing the web API I've been wanting to to manage DNS records in it.
