I was browsing some of the [IPv6 related blog posts on HE.net](http://ipv6.he.net/certification/popular_postings.php), and I came across [this interesting one](http://warrenkwok.blogspot.hk/2013/01/greylisting-and-dual-stack-mail-servers.html) regarding greylisting.

Because of "happy eyes" a connection that immediately fails on IPv6 will fail over to IPv4, so if greylisting is used only on IPv6 it will not be as effective as planned.
