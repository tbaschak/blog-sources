I opened an account on [github](https://github.com/) earlier this year. I have enjoyed contributing back to various projects I use, as well as committing some of the code I've written to a public repo for others to use/improve.

One of the repositories I committed is called [php-ldap-changepw](https://github.com/tbaschak/php-ldap-changepw). I wrote this code 5-6 years ago when I was working at Broadband Communications North (BCN), to allow users to change their own LDAP passwords instead of requiring them to use phpldapadmin. It is comprised of various example code I found on php.net's function documentation plus some logic. One of the first things I noticed when I was setting up LDAP/central logins at BCN was that there wasn't a simple php/ldap password change script. This isn't a turn-key solution yet, but it could be with some more work. Hopefully this encourages me to finish it up to that state, or someone else forks it and commits some code.

That is the fun of social coding.
