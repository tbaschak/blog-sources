I've joined forces with a group of local IPv6 experts at local Hackerspace, [SkullSpace](http://skullspace.ca/), to form an IPv6 Task Force. This is a really fantastic group of dedicated, well rounded individuals, all working together for a common goal -- to raise awareness about IPv6. 

We've been meeting casually, every week or two over the past month and a half to discuss what we would like to accomplish. Over the past weekend we got together for a mini hackathon style event to finally get some infrastructure online! We can do more than just ping across a link now, and not be denied by ACL!

	*	Must be readable by CxO's, they need the convincing

### Progress So Far

*	VM Server installed at colocation facility
*	Firewall installed in front of VM Server
*	Remote Office IPv6 enabled
*	ACLs in place between locations
*	Connectivity up between Colo and Remote Office
