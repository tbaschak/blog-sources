I've had CiscoDude.net and its associated services IPv6 enabled over native IPv6 for the past year. Before that some services were IPv6 enabled over a HE.net tunnel.

Webservices are the easiest I'd say, and were the first I implemented.

## Web Services

Web services are pretty easy to IPv6 enable. NGINX makes configuration especially simple with multiple listen lines:

```
	# HTTPS server
	server {
		listen			443 ssl spdy;
		listen			[::]:443 ssl spdy;
		server_name		secure.ciscodude.net;
```

Apache is similarly simple to configure. IPv4-in-IPv6 mapped addresses can make recognizing addresses a pain in your web applications sometimes. Complications have been fairly minimal, mainly with sessions that store the IP address. Privacy addressing, and switching between IPv6/v4 and back has caused occasional issues.

## Email

I run a typical Postfix/Dovecot system with Spamassassin and friends for mail. I have A and AAAA records for my mail server. The only complications I've had so far are:

*	Autoconfigured addresses don't get revdns, and so autoconfigured addresses need to be disabled for mail servers (and servers in general, when source address matters for ACLs, QoS, etc)
*	Greylisting: when things fail over from IPv6 to IPv4, mail takes longer to get delivered.
*	Spam filtering is heavily built around IPv4 at the moment.

## Jabber/XMPP

I run [Prosody](https://prosody.im/) for XMPP services. Prosody is very simple compared with many other XMPP servers, and has had IPv6 support since 0.9.x (w/ Lua Socket 3.0).

## DNS

### Recursive

Both of my internal DNS recursors are dual-stacked.

### DNS64/NAT64

My network is not setup for IPv6 only access at the moment, I will be adding DNS64/NAT64 in the next few months to begin testing one translation method. Apparently my Cisco ASA 5505 running firmware 9.0/9.1 should be able to do NAT64/DNS64 w/ AAAA synthesis.

### Authoritative

At the moment only one of my nameservers is dual-stacked, the rest are only IPv4 enabled.
